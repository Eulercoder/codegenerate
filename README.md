# Random Code Generator

Random Code Generatorâ€Šâ€”â€Šas the name suggests it will be generate random numbers. Now you must be thinking just random generators? really? There are hundreds of code snippets already available which can generate random numbers.


So, this is more than just Random Code Generator. Here are different type of codes that our system will be able to generate.

- Serial Numbers (N9TTâ€Šâ€”â€Š9G0Aâ€Šâ€”â€ŠB7FQâ€Šâ€”â€ŠRANC) 
- Strong Passwords ( )8V)CC3[k6Hj )
- Pronounceable Codes (azazer)
- Giftcard/Voucher Codes (744-NRY-264)
- Suffixed Codes (LRA-MEQ-A)
- Country prefixed codes (US-GXZSYU)
- Length â€˜Xâ€™â€” Letters and Digits (gYtpe4NB)
- Patternâ€Šâ€”â€ŠXX99??AA (XX9901AA)

# Why? Whatâ€™s the use? ðŸ¤”

There are lots of usage of this. You just need to spend some time, think the places where such random codes are used. Your Credit or Debit cards? Promotional codes maybe? In resetting a password Or Sending Unique Links for signups?

Many companies spend a lot of time in writing such codes and then creating a system which can validate the codes and verify it has been used before or not.

- We are going to create a system which will generate such random codes and then keep them in our database.

- We will have our API for generating random codes based on the cases and total codes required.

- There will be API for validating whether the code has been used before or not.

- Using our APIs, companies can generate thousands of random numbers and send them to their users once they get hacked ðŸ™ˆ ðŸ™‰.

- Using our APIs, companies can send unique sign up links, promotion code, vouchers to their users/customers.

- We will take care of everything for them from generation to validation.
